## Feature

### Flexible
It fits your usage needs, breaks the barrier of information sources, and conducts secondary screening, classification, and grouping of conversations and content at will. Let chat return to pure.
### Personality
The interface design follows Google's new design language - Material You. The theme is generated according to the wallpaper color (Android 12 only), with a variety of built-in color themes to choose from, just designed for you.

Layout adaptation for multiple screen sizes (mobile phones, foldable devices, tablets) and support for dark mode.
### Synchronize
Use Firebase Cloud Messaging to build a message synchronization network between different devices. Easily transfer the cost of message reception and greatly save background overhead.
### Plugin
Third-party plugins provide stable news sources. Users can build their own message source according to their usage habits. Messages from different sources can still be processed uniformly and efficiently.
### Follow best practices
Use MAD skills. The interface is built entirely using Jetpack Compose, the new toolkit for native Android interfaces. Jetpack libraries (including but not limited to `Paging 3` , `DataStore` , `Navigation` , `WorkManager` , `Room`) are used in persistence, navigation, background scheduling, architecture and more.

## Function

- Messaging: Supports the receiving and sending of common message types.
- Session Grouping: Group different sessions from different platforms into a new session.
- File management: independent file management page. Provides various filter conditions such as time, type, file size, etc.
- File Cloud Backup: Automatically back up the specified session files to the cloud, making it hard to miss and never lose.
- Notification evolution: notification channel, expand notification, quick reply, dialogue bubble
- System-level push: Use FCM to form a message synchronization network.
- Plug-in: third-party plug-ins provide richer and more stable information sources.
- Data Export: Export session data to local storage.
